                        <p>Sharon has 5 years experience training foster dogs to be more adoptable through both basic and advanced obedience training. 
                            <br><br>She has rehabbed an aggression case that was scheduled to be euthanized (Achilles, pictured to the left), who has become the smiling face of her brand. 
                            <br><br>She also has 8 years experience with pet sitting and 2 years experience working in a veterinarian's practice.
                            <br><br>Sharon hopes to build a community of dog owners and teach them about the basics of dog care - grooming, nutrition, training, and more.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Not every dog owner can afford obedience courses.</h3>
                        <p>Sharon wants to bring the training class experience to dog owners who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it (or don't have the hours to commit). In this group, you'll have first access to her online obedience workshops when they're available.</p>
